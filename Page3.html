            <h3> <font color="black " size="4"> One of the oldest traces of the “man in the machine” theme dates from 800 BC in Egypt . The statue of the god Amon raised its arm to designate the new pharaoh among the suitors who paraded in front of him, then she "delivered" a speech of consecration. The Egyptians were probably aware of the presence of a priest operating a mechanism and declaring the sacred words behind the statue, but this did not seem to them to be contradictory to the incarnation of the deity. Around the same time, Homer , in The Iliad (XVIII, 370–421), describes the automata made by the blacksmith god Hephaestus : tripods with gold wheels, capable of carrying objects as far as Olympus and returning alone to the god's abode; or again, two maids forged in gold who assist him in his task. Similarly, the Giant of bronze Talos , guard the shores of Crete , was sometimes considered a work of God.Vitruvius , a Roman architect, described the existence between the iii E and the i st  century BC, a school founded by engineers Ctesibius in Alexandria , and designing mechanisms for fun like crows singing. Heron The Elder describes in his treatise "Automata", a carousel animated by steam and considered to anticipate steam engines. Automatons then disappeared until the end of the Middle Ages . Roger Bacon has been credited with the design of speech-capable automatons; in fact, probably mechanisms simulating the pronunciation of certain simple words.

                  Leonardo da Vinci built an automaton in the shape of a lion in 1515 to amuse the King of France, François I 28 . Gio Battista Aleotti and Salomon de Caus , on the other hand, built artificial and singing birds, mechanical flautists, nymphs, dragons and animated satyrs to brighten up aristocratic festivals, gardens and caves. René Descartes, him, would have designed in 1649 an automaton which he called "my daughter Francine". He also leads a reflection of an astonishing modernism on the differences between the nature of automata, and those of animals on the one hand (no difference) and on the other hand that of men (no assimilation). These analyzes make him the little-known precursor of one of the main themes of science fiction  : the indistinction between the living and the artificial, between men and robots , androids or artificial intelligencesJacques de Vaucanson built in 1738 an "  artificial duck of gilded copper, which drinks, eats, quacks, dabbles and digests like a real duck  " . It was possible to program the movements of this automaton, thanks to gears placed on an engraved cylinder, which controlled rods crossing the legs of the duck.. The automaton was exhibited for several years in France, Italy and England, and the transparency of the abdomen made it possible to observe the internal mechanism. The device for simulating digestion and expelling a kind of green porridge is the subject of controversy. Some commentators believe that this green porridge was not made from the food ingested, but prepared in advance. Others believe that this opinion is based only on imitations of Vaucanson's duck. Fire Museum of Nizhny Novgorod in Russia, about 1879, destroyed this controller 29 . </font></h3>

            <h3> <font color="black" size"4">Craftsmen Pierre and Louis Jaquet-Droz manufactured some of the best automatons based on a purely mechanical system, before the development of electromechanical devices. Some of these automatons, by a system of multiple cams, were able to write a small note (always the same). Finally, Les Contes d'Hoffmann (and ballet ) L'Homme au sable describes a mechanical doll with which the hero falls in love. </font></h3>
