<h2 style="font-size:30px;"> The types: </h2>

There 4 types of the artificial intelligence they are :

 <ul>
  <li>Reactive Machines</li>
  <li>Limited Memory</li>
  <li>Theory of Mind</li>
  <li>Self Aware</li>
   <ul>

<h2 style="font-size:30px;"> Reactive Machines:</h2>
      <p  style="text-align:left; width: 900px; "> 
     
      Limited memory types refer to an A.I.’s ability to store previous data and/or predictions,
      using that data to make better predictions. With Limited Memory, machine learning 
      architecture becomes a little more complex. Every machine learning model requires limited
      memory to be created, but the model can get deployed as a reactive machine type
      </p>
      <h2 style="font-size:30px;" > Theory of Mind: </h2>
 
      <p style="text-align:left; width: 900;" > 
      The ability of the human mind to attribute mental states to others - is a key component 
      of human cognition.The same capability of inferring human mental states is a prerequisite
      for artificial intelligence (A.I.) to be integrated into human society.
      We have yet to reach Theory of Mind artificial intelligence types. These are only in their
      beginning phases and can be seen in things like self-driving cars. 
      In this type of A.I., A.I.begins to interact with the thoughts and emotions of humans.
      </p>
      <h2 style="font-size:30px;"> Self Aware: </h2>
 
      <p size="text-align:left; width: 900;">
      
      Finally, in some distant future, perhaps A.I. achieves nirvana. It becomes self-aware.
      This kind of A.I. exists only in story, and, as stories often do, instills both immense
      amounts of hope and fear into audiences. A self-aware intelligence beyond the human has
      an independent intelligence, and likely, people will have to negotiate terms with the 
      entity it created. What happens, good or bad, is anyone’s guess.
